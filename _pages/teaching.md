Currently, I am focused on my PhD research and do not have formal teaching experience. However, I am passionate about sharing knowledge and have mentored junior researchers and students in my research projects.

## Mentoring Experience

- **Research Mentoring**: Guided junior researchers in AIOps and network traffic classification projects
- **Student Collaboration**: Collaborated with undergraduate and graduate students on research projects
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Presented research findings at conferences and workshops

## Future Teaching Goals

As I progress in my academic career, I look forward to:
- Teaching courses in machine learning and systems
- Supervising student research projects
- Developing educational materials for AIOps and network analysis
