My research focuses on **ML for Systems and Systems for AI**. I began by working on ML for systems, but realized that advancing the field requires a deep understanding of underlying systems. This led me to pursue a PhD in systems, where I focus first on systems research and then on applying those insights to systems for ML.

I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Northeastern University, advised by Prof. Gene Cooperman and Prof. Devesh Tiwari. I received my M.S. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University, advised by Prof. Shu-Tao Xia and Prof. Xi Xiao, and my B.Eng. in Computer Science from Nankai University.

My industry experience includes a research internship at Bytedance Seed, a full-time role as Algorithm Engineer II at Alibaba Cloud, and an internship at Tencent WeChat. I have extensive hands-on experience debugging and optimizing production-scale cloud and AI infrastructures.
