# Project Images Needed

The following images are referenced in the project files and need to be added to the `assets/img/` directory:

## Systems for AI
- `llm_training.jpg` - Image representing LLM training clusters and straggler effects
- `bootseer.jpg` - Image showing BootSeer system architecture or startup optimization

## Pure Systems  
- `hotswap.jpg` - Image representing HotSwap serverless optimization architecture

## ML for Systems
- `self_healing.jpg` - Image showing AIHS system architecture or datacenter healing
- `network_traffic.jpg` - Image representing network traffic analysis and classification

## Image Requirements
- Recommended size: 800x600 pixels or similar aspect ratio
- Format: JPG or PNG
- Content: Should represent the technical concept or system architecture
- Quality: High resolution for professional appearance

## Current Status
- ✅ **BootSeer**: `bootseer.jpg` - Added and properly referenced
- ✅ **HotSwap**: `hotswap.jpg` - Added and properly referenced
- ✅ **AIHS (Self-healing)**: `self_healing.jpg` - Added and properly referenced  
- ✅ **Network Traffic**: `network_traffic.jpg` - Added and properly referenced
- ✅ **LLM Training Stragglers**: No image - will display without image

## Next Steps
- Create a dedicated image for LLM Training Stragglers project (optional)
- All projects now have proper images and will display correctly
