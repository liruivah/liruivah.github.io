AIHS (Automated Intelligent Healing System) represents a breakthrough in applying machine learning to achieve scalable self-healing in cloud-scale data centers. This research addresses the critical challenge of automatically detecting and repairing component failures in large-scale cloud infrastructure, achieving remarkable success rates in production environments.

## Research Objectives

The primary goal is to enable reliable and scalable cloud services through:
- **Automated Failure Detection**: Real-time monitoring and early warning systems
- **Intelligent Diagnosis**: Machine learning-based root cause analysis
- **Automated Recovery**: Self-healing mechanisms for common failure scenarios
- **Production Scalability**: Deploying ML solutions at cloud scale

## Technical Approach

AIHS employs a comprehensive ML pipeline:

### Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Raw Log Analysis**: Processing monitoring logs using NLP and time-series analysis
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying failure patterns and correlations
- **Predictive Modeling**: Forecasting potential failures before they occur
- **Action Recommendation**: Suggesting optimal repair strategies

### System Integration
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Deep integration with Alibaba Cloud management systems
- **Distributed Processing**: Handling large-scale, distributed infrastructure
- **Real-time Operations**: Continuous monitoring and automated response
- **AIOps Workflows**: Automated operations and maintenance processes

## Key Outcomes

This research has achieved:
- **92.4% success rate** in resolving 33.7 million production failures
- **51% reduction** in unavailable time per failed server
- Publication at SRDS 2021 (25.5% acceptance rate)
- Production deployment at Alibaba with 600K+ servers
- "Best Newcomer Award of AIS" recognition

## Impact

AIHS demonstrates the potential of AIOps in production:
- **Reliability Improvement**: Significantly enhanced system uptime and availability
- **Cost Reduction**: Lower maintenance costs and reduced manual intervention
- **Scalability**: Proven ML solutions for cloud-scale infrastructure
- **Industry Adoption**: Open-source prototype for public validation
